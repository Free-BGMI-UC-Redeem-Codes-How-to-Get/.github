# Free BGMI UC Redeem Codes: How to Get Them and What to Expect

**Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI)**, the Indian version of PUBG Mobile, has quickly become one of the most popular mobile games in India. The game's vast range of skins, outfits, weapons, and other in-game items has attracted millions of players. To unlock these premium items, players often need **UC (Unknown Cash)**, the in-game currency of BGMI. While many players buy UC using real money, there are some ways to obtain it for free through redeem codes.
